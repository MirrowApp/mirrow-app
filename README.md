# Mirrow

Mirrow is a tiny Astro experiment focused on making SVGs effortless. Design, style, and animate everything in one file and export code that works for React, Svelte, and other frameworksâ€”no extra CSS or scripts required.

## Getting Started
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`

## Status
Mirrow is currently in a preview/coming-soon state. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome.
