        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Since we don't collect any information, there's nothing to use. Mirrow
          operates entirely in your browser and is compiled on your server
          without sending data to our servers.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Data Storage and Security</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Your data never leaves your device. All SVG files, code, and projects
          you create with Mirrow are stored locally in your browser. We have no
          access to your work, and it's protected by your device's security
          measures.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Mirrow is a static website that may use CDN services for hosting
          files, but these services do not collect personal data. The
          application itself runs entirely in your browser without external
          dependencies that could access your data.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Your Rights</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Since we don't collect any personal information, there's no data to
          access, update, or delete. You have complete control over your work as
          it remains on your device. If you have any privacy concerns, you can
          contact us at privacy@mirrow.app.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Cookies and Tracking</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Mirrow may use essential cookies for basic functionality (like
          remembering your preferences), but we do not use any tracking cookies,
          analytics, or advertising cookies. Your browsing activity is not
          monitored or recorded.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Terms of Service</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-6">
          Last updated: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          By accessing or using Mirrow, you agree to be bound by these Terms of
          Service and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree
          with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using this service.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Description of Service</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Mirrow is an open-source, client-side web application that allows
          users to design, animate, and export SVG graphics. The service
          provides tools for creating vector graphics and generating code for
          various frameworks and platforms, all running locally in your browser.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">User Accounts</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Mirrow does not require user accounts or registration. The application
          works entirely client-side without any server-side authentication or
          data storage.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Acceptable Use</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">You agree not to use Mirrow to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
          <li>Create or distribute illegal, harmful, or offensive content</li>
          <li>Violate any intellectual property rights</li>
          <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems</li>
          <li>Interfere with the proper functioning of the service</li>
          <li>Use the service for any commercial purpose without permission</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You retain complete ownership of the content you create using Mirrow.
          Since all work is done client-side and never transmitted to our
          servers, we have no access to or claim over your creations. Mirrow
          itself is open-source software, and you may view, modify, and
          distribute the source code according to its license.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Service Availability</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Since Mirrow is a static website, it generally has high availability.
          However, as an open-source project, we cannot guarantee uninterrupted
          access. The application can also be self-hosted or run locally if
          needed.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, Mirrow shall not be liable for
          any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
          including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or use, arising
          out of or relating to your use of the service.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Termination</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Since Mirrow is a client-side application with no user accounts,
          there's no access to terminate. You can stop using the service at any
          time by simply closing your browser or navigating away from the
          website.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Since there
          are no user accounts, we will notify users of significant changes by
          updating this page. Your continued use of Mirrow after changes
          constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Open Source</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Mirrow is open-source software. You can view, modify, and distribute
          the source code according to its license. This transparency ensures
          you can verify our privacy claims and even run your own instance of
          the application.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Governing Law</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
          laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict of law
          principles.
